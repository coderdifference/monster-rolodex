# ~~Monster Rolodex~~ Catadex

This project follows the implementation of the Monster Rolodex exercise as part of the *Complete React Developer 2020* course.

I have and will be making changes to the course direction simply to test out and challenge my understanding of the material as presented.

## FAQ

### Cats?

Yes, cats. I prefer cats to monsters and this was another available set on [robohash](http://robohash.com)

### No email?

Cats do not have email addresses, they have mottos. Everyone should know this.

### FilterBox

Yes. Technically this is a filter box not a search box. I can be a stickler for trivialities like this. A filter reduces a dataset. We're even using the Array.filter implementation. It's a filter box.
